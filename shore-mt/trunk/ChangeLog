6.0.1-alpha: Mon May 24 10:15:01 MDT 2010

This is a major overhaul of the storage manager.

It is a port of the entire storage manager and its tests to true concurrent
pthreads. It no longer uses sthreads and its primitives. This release
is an extension of the 2009 SHORE-MT release.

Included are too many bug fixes and changes to enumerate them here.
The documentation is strictly html, built from the source files using
Doxygen; the .pdf files of prior releases are gone.

6.0.0-Beta: October 2010: Beta releases of the above.

6.0.0: December 2010: first non-beta release of the above.

6.0.1:  Minor changes: Updated hyper-refs to new UW web host; 
       makefile changes for maintenance purposes.
